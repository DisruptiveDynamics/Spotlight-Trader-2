    - "✅ 5-second ping/pong heartbeat with timestamp reset on reconnect"
    - "✅ Backpressure management (256KB threshold with 20-retry limit)"
    - "✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s→30s, max 10 attempts)"
    - "✅ Mutable WebSocket reference keeps send/close working post-reconnect"
    - "⏳ Needs runtime soak test (≥20s outages)"

    - "apps/client/src/lib/voiceWS.ts:41-67 (connect + heartbeat)"
    - "apps/client/src/lib/voiceWS.ts:115-146 (send with backpressure)"
    - "apps/client/src/lib/voiceWS.ts:100-114 (auto-reconnect)"

auth_cookies:
  grade: 8

  code_refs:
    - "apps/server/src/middleware/requirePin.ts:41-54 (Safari-safe config)"

dev_runtime:
  grade: 8
  reasons:

observability:
  grade: 9

    - "✅ Metrics registry with counters, gauges, histograms"
    - "✅ Proper histogram quantiles (p50, p95, p99) with sum/count"
    - "✅ Public endpoints (no auth) for monitoring systems"
    - "✅ JSON metrics moved to /api/metrics/json (protected)"
    - "⚠️ No structured log levels (could add Winston/Pino)"
  code_refs:
    - "apps/server/src/routes/metricsProm.ts"
    - "apps/server/src/routes/diag.ts"
    - "apps/server/src/metrics/registry.ts"
