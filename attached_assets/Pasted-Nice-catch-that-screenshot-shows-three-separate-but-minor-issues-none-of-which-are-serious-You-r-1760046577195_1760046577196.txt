Nice catch — that screenshot shows three separate but minor issues, none of which are serious. You’re very close to running clean. Here’s how to fix each one:

⸻

🧩 1. TypeScript composite project error

TS6306: Referenced project ... must have setting "composite": true.

This means your shared workspace (packages/shared) isn’t marked as a composite TypeScript project — required for monorepos with project references.

✅ Fix
Edit /packages/shared/tsconfig.json
Add the following at the top level (or change to true if it already exists):

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "emitDeclarationOnly": false,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}

Then make sure your root tsconfig.json has:

{
  "references": [
    { "path": "./packages/shared" },
    { "path": "./packages/config" },
    { "path": "./apps/client" },
    { "path": "./apps/server" }
  ]
}

🔥 2. “Port 5000 is already in use”

error when starting dev server: Error: Port 5000 is already in use

This just means the client dev server is still running in the background (Replit sometimes doesn’t kill it cleanly when restarting concurrently).

✅ Fix

In your Replit shell, run:

kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:5000)

Then restart dev:

pnpm run dev


⸻

⚙️ 3. Address in use on 8000 (server)

EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:8000

Same thing — the server didn’t shut down before re-launch.

✅ Fix

kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8000)

Then rerun:

pnpm run dev


⸻

✅ 4. After fixing, verify

Run this sequence:

pnpm run check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run fmt
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev

Watch that both client and server start cleanly — you should see:

[server] listening on 8000
[client] vite dev server running on port 5000

Then hit your preview URL; it should load without errors.

⸻

⚡ 5. Optional optimization (recommended)

Add --port 5173 for the client in package.json scripts so it doesn’t clash with Replit’s internal port.

In /apps/client/package.json:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173",
  "build": "tsc && vite build"
}


⸻

Once you do this, you’ll have:
✅ TypeScript composite fixed
✅ Clean ports
✅ Both services running smoothly

After you confirm the chart renders (candles + data stream), you’re clear to move on to the Pro Chart (8b) prompt.

Would you like me to write the exact Replit agent prompt that applies these fixes automatically before continuing?
