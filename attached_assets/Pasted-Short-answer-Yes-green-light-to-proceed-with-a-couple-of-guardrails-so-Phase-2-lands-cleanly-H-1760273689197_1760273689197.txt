Short answer: Yes — green-light to proceed, with a couple of guardrails so Phase 2 lands cleanly.

Here’s what I’d do next, in this order:

Lock down Phase 1 (quick checklist — 15 min)

SSE health: enable heartbeat/keep-alive + auto-reconnect; verify no duplicate listeners on hot reload.

Backpressure: cap callout queue length and drop oldest “watch” items first (never “now”).

Contracts frozen: snapshot the 10 tool schemas (types + version) so we don’t churn mid-build.

Perf probe: log tick→SSE→UI latency (p50/p95); target p50 <150 ms.

Idempotency: ensure callout IDs are unique and journal writes are exactly-once.

Phase 2 — Voice + Triggers (MVP)

Voice session manager

Single OpenAI Realtime session/tab; Shimmer default; session.update for voice changes; barge-in stops TTS instantly.

One state source drives the bubble (idle/connecting/listening/speaking/muted/error).

Acceptance: no overlapping audio after 50 rapid mute/unmute cycles.

Implement 3 high-value triggers first

VWAP reclaim/reject (2 closes + volume delta).

1–2m ORB with surge filter; cooldown after failed break.

9/20 EMA pullback in trend with shrinking pullback volume.

Each trigger emits: setup tag, entry zone, stop, T1/T2 (in R), invalidation, quality grade, urgency, and Rules Sentinel pass/fail.

Acceptance: false-alarm rate <10% on A-grade in playback; new bars roll correctly across 1/2/5/10/15/30/60m.

UI actions wired end-to-end

Overlay Accept / Reject / Snooze 30s → Accept auto-journals; Reject logs reason; Snooze suppresses symbol for window.

Journal records MAE/MFE, time-to-1R, and transcript snippet.

Phase 3 — Proactive & Pattern-aware

Hint Engine (minimal)

Attention score for your top 5–10 favorites (proximity to level + momentum + volume z-score + regime).

Pre-alerts: “Heads up: 2 conditions away from VWAP reclaim; window 2–5 min.”

Pattern Memory job

Nightly aggregate last 5/10/20 sessions per (symbol, timeframe, setup, regime) → EV(R), MAE/MFE p50, time-to-1R, false-break rate, volume/range z-scores, PDH/PDL & AVWAP behavior.

Runtime uses cached lookups only (no heavy compute on hot path).

Playback harness

6.5-hour replays (trend, chop, news) with assertions: lead time, precision/recall, latency, spam control.

A few surgical improvements (high ROI)

Breadth filter on index names (ADD/TICK/VOLD) to throttle longs/shorts.

Time-of-day regimes (open, midday, power hour) to scale trigger sensitivity.

Circuit breakers enforce cool-downs (already in Rules Sentinel — keep visible in UI).

Risks to watch

SSE dupes after hot reload → verify only one active EventSource.

Schema drift between tools and UI → lock types + add runtime guards.

Queue bloat during spikes → drop policy + backpressure.

If you want a single “Phase-2” agent prompt, you’re ready to run Voice Integration + Three Triggers + Overlay actions exactly as outlined above. I agree with the agent’s status and next steps; the sequence above will keep it fast, clean, and trader-useful.
