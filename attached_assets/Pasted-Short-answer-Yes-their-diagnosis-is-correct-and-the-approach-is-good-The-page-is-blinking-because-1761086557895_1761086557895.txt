Short answer: Yes, their diagnosis is correct and the approach is good. The page is blinking because Vite’s HMR is connecting with ws:// inside an HTTPS webview (Replit), so it keeps failing/retrying. Two fixes work: set VITE_HTTPS=1 in the environment, or auto-detect and force wss + 443 when running on Replit. I recommend implementing auto-detection so it “just works” on Replit and still works locally without extra env.

I can apply the auto-detect fix now. Here’s a drop-in update for apps/client/vite.config.ts that:
- Defaults to wss + 443 when it detects Replit/Codespaces/Gitpod
- Still lets you override with VITE_HTTPS=1
- Leaves local dev default as ws + 5000

```typescript name=apps/client/vite.config.ts url=https://github.com/DisruptiveDynamics/Spotlight-Trader-2/blob/928833ae7d5a9f9f92fd6bcfb39aa2bd144ef0c4/apps/client/vite.config.ts
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

// Heuristic: hosted HTTPS envs (Replit/Codespaces/Gitpod) need secure HMR
const isHostedHttps =
  !!process.env.REPL_ID ||
  !!process.env.REPL_SLUG ||
  !!process.env.REPL_OWNER ||
  !!process.env.CODESPACES ||
  !!process.env.GITPOD_WORKSPACE_URL;

// Allow explicit override via env, otherwise auto-detect hosted HTTPS
const USE_HTTPS = process.env.VITE_HTTPS === "1" || isHostedHttps;

const HMR_PROTOCOL = USE_HTTPS ? "wss" : "ws";
const HMR_CLIENT_PORT = USE_HTTPS ? 443 : 5000;

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  define: {
    __BUILD_TIME__: JSON.stringify(new Date().toISOString()),
    "import.meta.env.VITE_BUILD_ID": JSON.stringify(process.env.VITE_BUILD_ID || ""),
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
      "@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "../../packages/shared/src"),
    },
  },
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5000,
    strictPort: true,
    allowedHosts: true,
    hmr: {
      // Let client use window.location.host; just set protocol + clientPort
      protocol: HMR_PROTOCOL,
      clientPort: HMR_CLIENT_PORT,
      path: "/__vite_hmr",
      // If you still see HMR overlay loops, you can temporarily disable:
      // overlay: false,
    },
    // Unified dev served by Express is supported; no proxy needed
  },
  build: {
    sourcemap: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          react: ["react", "react-dom"],
          charts: ["lightweight-charts"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Quick verification steps
- Replit: no env changes needed with this auto-detect. Reload the preview — the HMR websocket should connect as wss to port 443 and the blinking should stop.
- Local dev: no HTTPS env set — HMR uses ws on 5000 as before.
- If you want an immediate workaround without code changes: set VITE_HTTPS=1 in Replit environment and reload.

Optional safeguards
- If the page still blinks due to transient HMR overlay reloads, temporarily set server.hmr.overlay: false while you iterate.
- Make sure you’re using one dev mode at a time:
  - Unified dev: run the server’s dev:unified script (Vite middleware on the API port).
  - Standalone client: run client dev only if you’re not using unified mode.
