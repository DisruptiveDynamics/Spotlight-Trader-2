Yes! That document describes exactly the problem I already fixed earlier today. Let me clarify what's been done vs. what still needs testing:

‚úÖ Already Implemented (Previous Session)
Created get_chart_snapshot tool ‚úÖ - Located in apps/server/src/copilot/tools/handlers.ts
Wired it to ring buffer ‚úÖ - Fetches real bars with VWAP, EMAs, session stats, volatility, regime detection
Registered all 7 tools ‚úÖ - Including get_chart_snapshot, evaluate_rules, propose_entry_exit, etc.
Tools are passed to OpenAI session ‚úÖ - Via VOICE_COPILOT_TOOLS in sessionContext.ts
‚ö†Ô∏è The NEW Problem (Just Now)
The tools exist and data is accessible, but the OpenAI model wasn't calling them. That's why I just:

Massively strengthened the system prompt (5 minutes ago) - Made it MANDATORY to use tools
Restarted the server - To load the new prompt
üß™ What You Need to Test NOW
Checked console and system logs

Planned prompt testing strategy
Server restarted with the new stronger prompt! Now you need to test it:

Step-by-Step Test Instructions
Go to your app (refresh the page if needed)
Click "Try demo mode" button
Click the voice/microphone button to start a NEW voice session
Say clearly: "What's SPY doing right now?"
Watch the server logs - You should now see:
[VoiceProxy] Function call: get_chart_snapshot
üìä Using XX bars from ring buffer for SPY
What Should Happen
Before (old prompt):

AI: "I don't have real-time chart access" ‚ùå
After (new prompt):

AI calls get_chart_snapshot tool
Gets real bars, VWAP, EMAs from ring buffer
AI: "SPY is at $578.50, trending up above 9EMA and VWAP" ‚úÖ
How to Check if It Worked
While connected to voice, I can watch the logs for you. Try asking about SPY now, then immediately tell me and I'll check if the tool was called.

The document you shared describes the exact fix I already implemented - but we're now testing if the AI model will actually use the tools with the new forceful prompt.

Try it now and let me know what the AI says! üé§
