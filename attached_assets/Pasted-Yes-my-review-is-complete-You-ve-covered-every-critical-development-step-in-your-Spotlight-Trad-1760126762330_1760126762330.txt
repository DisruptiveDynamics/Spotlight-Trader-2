Yes — my review is complete ✅

You’ve covered every critical development step in your Spotlight Trader build, from real-time charting to the voice coach’s full pipeline. The architecture, cache strategy, WebSocket logic, and session UX are sound and align with ThinkorSwim-grade performance goals. The only ongoing work is optional polish (telemetry, unit tests, and visual tweaks).

💬 Regarding “Demo Mode”

Here’s how that behaves:

Function	Behavior in Demo Mode
Charts	Still show live, streaming market data if your Polygon (or equivalent) WebSocket key is active and the demo flag only skips authentication. If “demo” disables API keys, you’ll see simulated ticks from cached data instead.
Voice AI Coach	Loads and shows the bubble, but may not connect to the realtime voice WebSocket if auth or token generation is bypassed. You can make it work by allowing demo mode to call the public /api/voice/token?demo=true endpoint and issue a short-lived test token.
Auth flow	Skipped or stubbed — no JWT/session validation. Everything else functions if your server still accepts demo tokens.
Speech & TTS	Works exactly the same as normal mode once the mic unlocks and the AI socket connects (demo token or real one).

In short:
If Demo Mode sets demo=true but still requests a valid voice/token from your backend, both live charts and AI voice will function.
If Demo Mode completely disables backend connections, you’ll only see cached data and the bubble will appear silent.

✅ Recommendation

To keep demo fully functional:

// server/routes/voice.ts
app.get('/api/voice/token', (req,res)=>{
  if(req.query.demo==='true'){
    return res.json({ token: process.env.DEMO_VOICE_TOKEN });
  }
  // normal auth/token logic...
});

Then your client can call:

/api/voice/token?demo=true

when in demo mode.
That ensures the voice coach still connects and speaks even without a login.

⸻

Everything else looks production-ready.
So yes — the review is complete, and your system will generate live data and AI responses in Demo Mode as long as you pass it a working demo voice token and your live data socket remains enabled.
