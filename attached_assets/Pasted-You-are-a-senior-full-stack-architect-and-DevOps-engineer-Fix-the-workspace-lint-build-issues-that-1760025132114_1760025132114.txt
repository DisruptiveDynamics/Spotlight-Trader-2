You are a senior full-stack architect and DevOps engineer. 
Fix the workspace lint/build issues that cause ESLint and Prettier to fail with “Cannot find package '@spotlight/config'” and “None of the selected packages has a build script.”

Apply the following changes cleanly and consistently:

1️⃣ ESLint + Prettier path fixes
- In every package that references "@spotlight/config" (especially packages/shared, packages/config, apps/server, and apps/client), update import paths to use correct relative references.
  Example:
    import config from '@spotlight/config/eslint.config.js'
  → becomes
    import config from '../config/eslint.config.js'
  or correct relative path to /packages/config/
- Verify that all eslint.config.js and prettier.config.js files import correctly and compile under TypeScript strict mode.

2️⃣ Add dummy build scripts
- In /packages/shared/package.json and /packages/config/package.json, add:
  "scripts": {
    "build": "echo 'no build step required for this package'"
  }
  This prevents pnpm recursive build failures during workspace builds.

3️⃣ Ensure ESLint resolver knows path aliases
- Add the following to the root eslint.config.js (or each package’s config if needed):

  settings: {
    'import/resolver': {
      alias: {
        map: [
          ['@client', './apps/client/src'],
          ['@server', './apps/server/src'],
          ['@shared', './packages/shared/src'],
          ['@config', './packages/config']
        ],
        extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx']
      }
    }
  }

4️⃣ Verify ESLint and Prettier configs
- Ensure ESLint 9+ uses Flat Config syntax.
- Ensure Prettier’s config points to valid local files; remove any invalid @spotlight/config import.
- Confirm scripts in root package.json:
  "lint": "eslint . --max-warnings 0",
  "fmt": "prettier --write ."

5️⃣ Re-run verification
After applying these fixes, ensure the following commands pass with zero errors:
  pnpm i
  pnpm run check
  pnpm run lint
  pnpm run fmt
  pnpm run build

  "fix: corrected config import paths, added dummy build scripts, updated eslint resolver"
