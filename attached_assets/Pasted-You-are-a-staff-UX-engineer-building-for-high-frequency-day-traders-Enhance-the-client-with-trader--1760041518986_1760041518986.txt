You are a staff UX engineer building for high-frequency day traders. Enhance the client with trader-grade ergonomics, minimal cognitive load, and instant control. Keep WCAG AA contrast, TypeScript strict, and small commits.

GOALS
- Zero-lag interactions and keyboard-first control
- High-salience signals with minimal noise
- Fast context switching (multi-timeframe sync, focus modes)
- Risk & latency awareness at a glance

FEATURES

1) Pro Hotkeys & Command Routing
- Add a central HotkeyManager with default bindings:
  T: Push-to-talk (hold on mobile, toggle on desktop)
  Space: Pause/resume live stream (freeze chart)
  A: Set alert at cursor price
  J: New journal note (modal)
  G then V: Toggle VWAP anchors (full-session / pre-market / custom anchor)
  1/2/3: Switch timeframes (1m/5m/15m)
  Cmd/Ctrl+K: Command palette (already added) – extend with “Explain this bar”, “Jump to last signal”, “Toggle focus mode”
- Display a tiny cheat-sheet in the command palette footer.

2) Focus Modes (No-Distraction & Review)
- “Focus: Trade” mode hides non-essential panels (Rules/Journal) and enlarges Chart+Coach; dim non-price UI with 30% opacity.
- “Focus: Review” mode pins Journal + Signals timeline, freezes live stream, and enables bar-by-bar stepper.
- Persist mode per user in local storage and coach_profiles.

3) Multi-Timeframe Sync & Anchored VWAPs
- Add a secondary mini-chart (sparkline) that mirrors symbol but different timeframe (default 5m when main is 1m).
- Implement Anchored VWAP controls:
  - Buttons: Session, Premarket, Custom (date/time picker)
  - Visual chip on chart showing active anchor & offset from price
- Ensure evaluator and signal cards can reference `vwap_session()` & anchored variants visually.

4) Signal Salience & Noise Controls
- Add a “signal density” slider (Quiet / Normal / Loud) that gates:
  - Minimum confidence threshold
  - Regime alignment requirement (trend/range)
  - Tape confirms (volume_z, spread_bp) – use stricter values in Quiet
- In Quiet mode, only show 1 “Top opportunity” card at a time (others stack silently in Alerts panel).
- Add a subtle chime for actionable signals (respect prefers-reduced-motion/audio).

5) Latency & Health HUD
- Small HUD in the top bar:
  - RTT (voice), Tick→Wick P95 (rolling), SSE reconnects count, Market status (LIVE / HALTED / PREMARKET).
- Color code: green < 120 ms, amber 120–180, red > 180.
- Tooltips explain how to improve when amber/red.

6) Tape Peek (lightweight, optional)
- Add an optional right-side collapsible “Tape” panel showing:
  - Volume z-score mini-bar (last 2 min)
  - Uptick–downtick delta sparkline
  - Spread (bp) badge
- Keep it render-cheap (no Level 2 DOM).

7) Chart Micro-UX
- Cursor readout: price, delta vs VWAP/anchor, RSI(14), EMA20/50.
- Hover a SignalCard → emit “highlight:candle” and add a 1-candle glow.
- Double-click chart → quick “Set alert @ <price>” modal prefilled.

8) Color & Accessibility Options
- Add Color Vision presets (Protanopia/Deuteranopia/Tritanopia safe palette).
- Toggle “High Contrast” mode (increase text and border contrast by ~15–20%).
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion to disable shimmer and wave forms.

9) Performance Safeguards
- Debounce UI updates in Alerts panel to at most 10Hz.
- Coalesce microbar paints via requestAnimationFrame; lock max FPS to 60.
- Lazy-load Tape and Journal editors only when opened.

TESTS
- HotkeyManager unit tests for keymaps and command dispatch.
- Focus mode snapshot (panels hidden/visible as expected).
- HUD numbers render and color thresholds flip correctly.
