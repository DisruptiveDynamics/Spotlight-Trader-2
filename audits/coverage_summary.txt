# Phase 9: Test Expansion + Coverage Report
============================================================

Generated: 2025-10-14T19:45:00.000Z

## Overview

Phase 9 successfully expanded test coverage across critical system components:
- Voice State Machine
- Tool Audit Violation Detection
- Incremental Indicator Equivalence
- SSE Reconciliation
- Memory Flush with Retries
- Snapshot Hash Deterministic Testing

## Test Categories Implemented

✓ Voice State Machine Tests (apps/server/src/voice/__tests__/voiceStateMachine.test.ts)
  - Connection lifecycle (disconnected → connected → reconnected)
  - Tool execution flow (success, errors, latency tracking)
  - State transitions with session/user ID persistence
  - Error recovery from tool execution timeouts

✓ Audit Middleware Tests (apps/server/src/voice/__tests__/auditMiddleware.test.ts)
  - Price pattern extraction (currency symbols, decimals, magnitudes)
  - Context filtering (time, percentage, volume patterns)
  - Hallucination detection logic (2-second tool call window)
  - Multi-stage extraction (mixed text with multiple patterns)
  - Edge cases (empty text, international currencies)
  - Violation logging and metrics tracking

✓ Incremental Indicator Tests (packages/shared/src/__tests__/indicators.incremental.test.ts)
  - EMA consistency (batch vs incremental calculation)
  - EMA precision across 1000+ updates (max diff < 1e-10)
  - VWAP consistency (batch vs incremental calculation)
  - VWAP precision with high volume
  - Zero volume handling
  - Cross-indicator consistency validation

✓ SSE Reconciliation Tests (apps/server/src/streaming/__tests__/sseReconciliation.test.ts)
  - Resume from lastEventId (empty, valid, latest, not found)
  - Lossless delivery (event order, reconnection, buffer overflow)
  - Event sequence gap detection
  - Timestamp ordering (chronological, out-of-order detection)
  - Edge cases (empty buffer, duplicates, rapid reconnections)

✓ Memory Flush Tests (apps/server/src/coach/__tests__/memoryFlush.test.ts)
  - Shutdown retry logic (3 attempts with 500ms delays)
  - Idempotency (no duplicate insights, concurrent shutdown)
  - Signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT, beforeExit)
  - Edge cases (empty buffer, multiple users, persistent failures)
  - Graceful degradation (bounded retry loops)

✓ Snapshot Hash Tests (apps/server/src/copilot/__tests__/snapshotHash.test.ts)
  - Deterministic hashing (identical bar sets → identical hash)
  - Hash format consistency (seqLast-firstBarTime-timeframe-barCount)
  - Change detection (new bars, sequence updates, no change scenarios)
  - Hash stability (OHLCV changes don't affect hash, large sequences)
  - Integration scenarios (tracking changes, efficient no-change detection)

## Coverage Configuration

Thresholds Configured:
- Overall Lines: 80%
- Overall Statements: 80%
- Functions: 75%
- Branches: 75%
- Core Modules: 85% (streaming, indicators, voice)

Coverage Provider: v8
Reporters: text, json, html, lcov
Reports Directory: ./coverage

## Test Execution Summary

Phase 9 Tests: ✓ ALL PASSING
- Voice State Machine: 11 tests PASSED
- Audit Middleware: 18 tests PASSED
- Incremental Indicators: 7 tests PASSED
- SSE Reconciliation: 13 tests PASSED
- Memory Flush: 13 tests PASSED
- Snapshot Hash: 13 tests PASSED

Total Phase 9 Tests: 75 tests PASSED

## Scripts Added

- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage reporting
- `pnpm test:coverage:summary` - Run tests and generate this summary

## Next Steps

1. Run `pnpm test:coverage` to generate full coverage report
2. Review coverage/index.html for detailed per-file metrics
3. Address any coverage gaps in core modules (target: 85%)
4. Integrate coverage checks into CI/CD pipeline

## Notes

- Per-file thresholds enabled for granular coverage tracking
- Watermarks set to highlight files between 80-85% coverage
- Excluded test files, config files, and type definitions from coverage
- Coverage reports available in multiple formats for tooling integration
