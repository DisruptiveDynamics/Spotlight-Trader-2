## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application utilizes a TypeScript monorepo with pnpm workspaces, consisting of `apps/client` (React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS), `apps/server` (Node.js 20 Express), and shared packages.

**Real-Time Data Pipeline**: A deterministic, lossless data pipeline handles live market data, integrating Polygon REST API for historical data and tick-by-tick streaming down to 50ms microbars. Server-Sent Events (SSE) are used for streaming market data and trading alerts with lossless resume capabilities. It supports 24/7 Polygon data with extended hours and uses a server-authoritative timeframe system with multi-timeframe rollups from a 1-minute buffer.

**Communication Protocols**:
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For streaming market data and trading alerts.
- **WebRTC (via OpenAI Agents SDK)**: For browser-to-OpenAI audio streaming for the voice coach, secured with ephemeral client tokens.

**Data Storage Strategy**:
- **Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM**: Stores versioned trading rules, user customizations, signals, and journal entries. Pgvector is planned for semantic memory.
- **Redis (Upstash)**: Planned for session management, rate limiting, and distributed ring buffer persistence.
- **In-Memory Structures**: Used for ring buffer and bar builder state for sub-millisecond latency.

**Security Model**: A 6-digit PIN authentication system with JWT-based sessions stored in httpOnly cookies. A `requirePin` middleware protects all API routes, SSE streams, and WebSocket upgrade handlers. Additional security includes Helmet.js, strict CORS, connection limits, and Zod for environment validation.

**Frontend Architecture**: Built with React 18 and TypeScript, featuring Lightweight Charts, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a professional charting system, a TOS-style toolbar, and a Pane component for multi-chart grids.

**Rules Engine Architecture**: Facilitates strategy automation and AI explanations through expression evaluation, signal generation with risk governance, and AI explanation generation using OpenAI API.

**Journaling & Memory System**: Provides structured trade tracking and automated end-of-day summaries. The Coach Memory System uses Pgvector to store and retrieve `playbook`, `glossary`, `postmortem`, and `knowledge` memories with OpenAI embeddings. A knowledge upload pipeline ingests YouTube videos, PDFs, and text notes with semantic chunking.

**Continuous Learning Loop & Backtesting**: An event-driven system with in-memory feature flags and a database schema for user feedback. A deterministic backtest harness evaluates historical data.

**Voice Presence Control System**: A voice interface with core audio infrastructure, UI components, performance optimizations, a Voice Tools Registry (7 tools), function call routing, callout streaming, and tool-powered responses. The coach ("Nexa", she/her) has a persistent, warm identity.

**Trader UX Pack**: Focuses on professional ergonomics including a Hotkey System, Focus Modes (`Trade Mode`, `Review Mode`, `Normal Mode`), Signal Density Control, Anchored VWAP, Latency & Health HUD, Tape Peek, Accessibility features, and Performance Safeguards.

**Realtime Copilot System**: An intelligent trading assistant providing real-time pattern recognition, proactive alerts, and trade assistance. It's built on a deterministic event-driven architecture with SSE streaming for sub-200ms latency. Key components include a Telemetry Bus, a 10-tool Tool Registry, Copilot Broadcaster, Rules Sentinel for risk governance, and Pattern Memory. It features an event-driven Trigger System and UI for `CalloutsOverlay`.

**AI Intelligence & Proactive Coaching**: The AI coach has unrestricted tool usage, memory integration, trader behavior analysis, and proactive market monitoring. Coach Policy enhancements ensure real-time data access, mandatory tool calls, and ultra-brief responses. A Voice Memory Bridge captures insights, and a Trader Pattern Detector analyzes journal history. The Proactive Coaching Engine monitors market alerts, feeding into tool-powered voice responses, using the `gpt-realtime` model.
